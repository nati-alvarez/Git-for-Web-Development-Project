5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
   The box model describes all the content and properties that affect how much space an element takes up on a web page.
   This includes the actual content of the element, the padding, border and margin. So, the space and element takes up isn't
   just what you define it's width or height as, but also any padding, borders, or margins you add to it. The "fix" to this
   is to use the box-sizing propery and set it to border-box. This will include the padding and borders in the elements
   width and height values.
